Version: 0.2.0
Date: 26. 02. 2026

  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed crash with modded battery types (e.g. battery-mk3-equipment) by adding a generic fallback shadow entity
    - Fixed shadow entities not being cleaned up when player changes surface (e.g. traveling to another planet in Space Age)
  Optimizations:
    - Cached active pole reference so lightning arc redraws skip the spatial search
  Features:
    - Added native support for Space Age battery-mk3-equipment in power consumption stats
    - Removed configurable interval setting, hardcoded to sensible defaults
    - Lightning arcs now attach to the correct height for each pole type instead of always using substation height
    - Added 9 locales: German, French, Spanish, Brazilian Portuguese, Japanese, Chinese, Russian, Korean, Polish
